1. If you want to build WINCE42 driver for ADM851X, please put the respective
   directoy (e.g. IFXADM8511 for ADM8511 LAN chip) on the WINCE42 direcoty
   \WINCE420\PUBLIC\COMMON\OAK\DRIVERS. 

2. Select "Open Build Release Directory" on "Build" option under WINCE42
   Builder Platform and change to the directory that the driver is located
   at. And then you can run "build" or "build -cf"(rebuild all drivers)
   to build up your drivers in DLL format which will locate at the platform
   (X86/Samsung SMDK2410/Intel DBPXA250) directoy in the WINCE42 target
   directory \WINCE420\PUBLIC\COMMON\OAK\TARGET.

3. There are two directories "LANUSB" and "LANNDS" in each ADM851X WINCE42
   driver directory (e.g. IFXADM8511). The files in "LANNDS" are the same
   for all ADM851X chips. But the file "LANUSB.C" in "LANUSB" is different
   for each ADM851X. The main difference is the definition for "PRODUCT_ID".
   The "PRODUCT_ID" for ADM8511, ADM8513 and ADM8515 are 8511, 8513 and 8515
   respectively.
